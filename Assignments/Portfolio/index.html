                I have done 1 month remote internship from CodSoft in C++ Programming where I created a simple calculator, a number guessing game and tic-tac-toe game.
                I gained a lot of experience. It was challenging but interesting as well. I created a graphical user interface so that users can have an user-friendly experience, also it looks attractive.
                <br>
                I have also created 3D games in AltWorld and earned up to 2500/-. It was interesting as well as challenging.

                I created a car parking system based on IOT(Internet of Things). I used arduino UNO, breadborad, jumper wires, ultrasonic sensor, LED bulbs, LCD screen, resistor and a buzzer.
                I used embedded C language and Arduino IDE platform. It was quite challenging at first but it became interesting as I progressed in it.

                I created a website named The Cosmos which featured an animated solar-system made from scratch. I used languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was really fun makiing this website as I am very interested about the mysteries of the universe.

                I   created a user profile page where users can login themselves by creating a profile. This webpage has a database connection which helps in keeping the records of the users who have created their profiles. I used HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript including Apache Xampp Cotrol Panel.
