    <h1 align="center"> The Evolution and Impact of Technology</h1>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><mark>Technology</mark> is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals, especially in a <mark>reproducible way</mark>. The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as <mark>software</mark>. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.</p>

    <p>Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the <mark>stone tool</mark>, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the <mark>Ice Age</mark>. The invention of the wheel in the <mark>Bronze Age</mark> allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the <mark>printing press, telephone, and the Internet</mark>, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.</p>
        
    <p>While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like <mark>pollution and resource depletion</mark>, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from <mark>automation</mark>. As a result, there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides.</p>
